This file is a general overview of my agentic teaching repository for SQL.
The agent's main instruction is in CLAUDE.md (the prompt itself is hidden from the public view).

I am using a local Postgres with database schema listed in schema.md (contains tables + data examples).

Files:
- schema.md - database schema - tables + data examples
- question_examples.md - 10 examples of good questions (currently - 4.12) + code snippets that would be used to find the answers (POTENTIAL ANSWERS)

TO DO:

- Instructions for the agent
- A file structure which will contain feedback/tasks archive and current tasks - I'm aiming for brevity and clarity here (memory saving)
