## Task 1: Customer Segmentation with NTILE

**Scenario:**
The marketing team wants to segment users into 5 equal groups (quintiles) based on their total order spending. Calculate each user's total spend and assign them to a quintile (1-5, where 1 = lowest spenders, 5 = highest spenders).

**Expected Output Columns:**
- `user_id` (integer)
- `total_spent` (numeric) — sum of all order amounts for this user
- `spending_quintile` (bigint) — quintile ranking (1-5)
- `users_in_quintile` (bigint) — count of users in the same quintile

**Requirements:**
- Use `orders` table
- Apply NTILE(5) window function to create quintiles
- Calculate total spending per user
- Only include users with at least 1 order
- Group to count users per quintile
- Order by `spending_quintile` ASC

**Difficulty Rating:** 3/5

## Task 2: Products Never Purchased Together

**Scenario:**
The e-commerce team wants to identify products that have NEVER been purchased together in the same order. For a specific product (e.g., product_id = 1), find all other products that have never appeared in any order containing that product.

**Expected Output Columns:**
- `product_id` (integer) — ID of product never bought with product 1
- `product_name` (varchar)
- `times_sold` (bigint) — how many times this product has been sold (in any order)

**Requirements:**
- Use `orders_products` and `products` tables
- Use anti-join pattern to find products never in same orders as product_id = 1
- Exclude product_id = 1 itself from results
- Calculate how many times each product has been sold
- Order by `times_sold` DESC

**Difficulty Rating:** 4/5

## Task 3: Median Session Count Per User

**Scenario:**
The analytics team wants to find the median number of sessions per user across all users. Calculate the median of total sessions (sum of count_sessions) for each user.

**Expected Output Columns:**
- `median_sessions` (numeric) — the median total session count across all users

**Requirements:**
- Use `user_sessions_daily` table
- Calculate total sessions per user (SUM of count_sessions)
- Use PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) to find the median
- Return a single row with the median value

**Difficulty Rating:** 3/5

## Submission Instructions

Submit your SQL solutions when ready. I'll provide detailed feedback on:
- Logic correctness and query structure
- Window function usage
- Efficiency considerations
- Alternative approaches

## Tips

- NTILE(n) divides rows into n equal buckets based on ordering
- PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) calculates the median (50th percentile)
- For "never together" queries, use NOT EXISTS or anti-join patterns
- Remember to aggregate before applying NTILE

Good luck!
